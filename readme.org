#+title: Org file to beautiful Tufte html with one command

I really like the design of Edward Tufteâ€™s handouts. However, there is no single command for just exporting a org file to the Tufte-like html for lazy people like me or newbie who don't know too much about org mode setups. Although there is [[https://github.com/dakrone/ox-tufte][ox-tufte]] intending to do the job, it didn't solve that the org-exported html template is not totally compatible with the [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][Tufte CSS]] and the generated page is not responsive on mobile device. Also, its configuration makes it hard to use for newbie. Based on my own taste, I added some nice features by tweaking the html template and curating my own CSS. see https://zilongli.org/code/tufte.css, https://zilongli.org/code/org.css.

* Features
- modern responsive html page powered by curated CSS.
- one command =M-x export-org-tufte-html= just give me what I want
- use fast and powerful =katex= instead of =mathjax= to render math.
- nice source code display by using =et-book-ligatures= font
- just works without having any org options eg =#+html_head:=
- disable full-width figures in default.

* Installation

** manual

Just fetch [[file:org-tufte.el]] and save it somewhere. Then load it

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-tufte")
(require 'org-tufte)
#+end_src

** use-package

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-tufte
  :ensure nil
  :init (add-to-list 'load-path "PATH*")
  :config
  (require 'org-tufte)
  (setq org-tufte-htmlize-code t)
  )
#+end_src

* Customization

I feel being distracted by too many colors when reading blogs. Although the highlight of code block is not enabled, you can get this feature by =(setq org-tufte-htmlize-code t)=
